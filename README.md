# Car_Parking_Lot
The ParkingLot class manages parking slots for big, medium, and small cars. It initializes with a set number of slots for each type. The addCar method parks a car based on its type, returning true if a slot is available, or false if it's full. The main method tests this by parking cars of each type and displaying the results.
